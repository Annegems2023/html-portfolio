<h1>The Best Movies According to Roxanne</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favourite Movies</h2>

<h3>Uncommon Grace</h3>

<p>It was a story of an Amish guy named Levi who loves reading other books than the only one book allowed for Amish community to read which is the Bible. 
    Along the course of the movie, he met a lady named Grace who was a military nurse on the last week of her vacation who also happened to be a close neighbor.
    Their paths crossed following the horrific shooting incident that killed Levi's step father. One morning upon arriving home, Levi discovered that his father 
    along with his pregnant mother was shot. Not knowing what else to do, he ran to the nearest neighbor and asked for help. Fortunately, Grace, who is a nurse
    was home that time so she responded right away. Sadly,Levi's father didn't make it but his wounded pregnant mother who was also shot was rushed to the hospital
    and managed to survive along with the baby in her womb whom is forced to be born to the world prematurely. The Amish community has a very strict religious standards
    to follow which includes not having affairs with outsiders or else they will be shunned by the community. As the plot continues to unfold, you will find very
    uncommon and exciting twists to the story. I highly recommend you watch it yourself.

<h3>A Walk to Remember</h3>

<p>It was a very moving story. You can watch it yourself.</p>

<h3>The Days of Adeline</h3>

<p>It is about the story of a woman who stopped aging following her involvement in a car accident in one rainy night. It was as if she was immortal. She constantly
    needs to change her identity to keep her secret which means also leaving the family she loves - her husband and daughter. At first, it seemed like a great opportunity
    at eternity but as time goes, she realized it was a very lonely journey to not be able to grow old with the ones she loves.
